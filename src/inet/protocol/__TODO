considerations for generic modular protocol and queueing elements:
 - gates are either passive or active
   active output gate -> passive input gate (push)
   passive output gate -> active input gate (pull)
 - gates can be pushed or pulled
 - communication between elements is either synchronous (push/pull) or asynchronous (send)
 - processing granularity is either packet base (as a whole) or streaming (start/progress/stop)
 - processing of a single element (input -> output):
   - packet -> packet
   - packet -> streaming
   - streaming -> packet
   - streaming -> streaming
